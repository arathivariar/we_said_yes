Design:
I started with a wireframe on paper with pencil as shown below:
//Insert the wireframe here

Text & Background colour
I selected both the text and background colours suitable for a wedding invitation. I wanted to keep the colour palette breezy with pastel colours and include images related to wedding. I have used a darker shade for the header and the footer to provide some contrast from the main sections.

Home Page Hero Image
A Hero Image is used on the “About Us” Page (only) under the Header. The cover text over the Hero Image, 'About Us', has been added to enhance  the design. 
//Insert an image of Hero Image with cover text overlay

About Us page
This page provides the user an idea about what the website provides. I have used a minimalistic approach with just one hero image and some description text about what we do.

Wedding Invitation page
In this page, the user can find the details about the wedding like the bride and groom, wedding date and time and wedding venue. Also, there is a Google Maps link to reach the venue. There is a pretty background image on this page for the invitation text.

RSVP page
Here in this page, the user can respond to the invitation with an RSVP. The RSVP form had input fields for First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email Address, Radio Buttons to accept or decline the invitation, a text are for an optional message to the host and a submit button. 
Once the user submits the form, it redirects to a “Thank You” page.
